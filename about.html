            <h1 class="main-top">About Me</h1>
            <p class="main-body" id="about-main">My name is Bob Valentic. I'm a twenty six-year-old 
                software developer living in Detroit,  MI. I graduated from Michigan State University
                 - class of 2014, go green! - with a BS in Astrophysics and a minor in Film Studies. 
                When I'm not busy coding, either at work or in my spare time, you can most likely 
                find me eating pizza and listening to music. I enjoy unwinding by going to concerts 
                (ask me about the last five concerts I've been to!) and playing music of my own. Some 
                other hobbies include watching movies (sci-fi and space movies are my favorite, see 
                college major listed above), writing, and even curling up with the occasional book.
                Many of these hobbies usually involve a nice glass of beer while I'm doing them. If 
                anything I mentioned above sounds appealing to you, or you have any questions, or you
                just want to chat, feel free to reach out using any of the links below!
