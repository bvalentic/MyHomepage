        Hi there! Welcome, and thanks for checking out my site! Even if you stumbled upon it by 
        accident, or if the only reason you're looking at it is because you need to grade it, 
        it's great to have you!
    </p>

    <p class="main-body">
        This website is for you to learn more about me and what I do best. No, it's not eating pizza and 
        rambling about science, it's coding! Although, I guess you can't do that without those, so yeah.
        In this site, you can find some facts about me, my hobbies, and a brief selection of some projects
        I've worked on. 
    </p>

    <p class="main-body">
        So what are you waiting for? Check it out!!
    </p>
